# Experiments of the paper "Representative Datasets: The Perceptron Case"

Four experiments were developed:

1. Iris dataset experiment,
2. Digits dataset experiment.
3. Different synthetic datasets. 

In all of them three sets were considered, the original dataset, the
dominating dataset and a random dataset. Besides, the Algorithm based
in proximity graphs and dominating sets was implemented and can be
found in the [auxiliary_fun.py](https://github.com/Cimagroup/Experiments-Representative-datasets/blob/master/notebooks/auxiliary_fun.py).

### List of main needed libraries

* ripser
* keras
* gudhi
* Giotto-tda


#### Experiments were run on a computer with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10750H CPU @ 2.60GHz
