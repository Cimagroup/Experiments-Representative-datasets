# Experiments of the paper "Representative Datasets: The Perceptron Case".

Three experiments were developed:

1. Iris dataset experiment,
2. Two interlaced torus dataset experiment,
3. Digits dataset experiment.

In all of them three sets were considered, the original dataset, the
dominating dataset and a random dataset. Besides, the Algorithm based
in proximity graphs and dominating sets was implemented and can be
found in Docs folder.

In order to run all the experiment, move docs folder files into the
same folder as the Jupyter notebooks. Then, it should run without any
problem.


### List of needed libraries

* ripser
* keras
* gudhi


#### Experiments were run on a computer with four AMD opteron 6348 processor running at 2,8GHz using 256 GB of RAM and 1 nVidia Tesla K40.


#### Take in account that some of the cells of the notebooks might take a long time to perform.
